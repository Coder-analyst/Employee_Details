This is a simple Python project that creates and manages an employee database using a text file. It allows users to store and display details of employees, such as their name, age, employee number, mobile number, salary, post, and more. 

## Features
- Creates a new text file to store employee information.
- Records details for at least 8 employees.
- Supports salary increments and stores updated salary details.
- Allows easy reading and updating of employee data.
- Displays all employee records in a user-friendly format.

## How It Works

2. It appends employee details to the file, including:
   - Name
   - Age
   - Employee Number
   - Mobile Number
   - Salary and Increment
   - Post
   - Office Name
   - Address
   - Work Mode (Online/Offline)
3. Displays all the stored data in the terminal.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No additional libraries are required.

## Usage
Run the program using Python. It will:
1. Create a file if it doesnâ€™t exist.
2. Add predefined employee details.
3. Display all stored employee details.
